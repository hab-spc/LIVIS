#bin/sh

# This is the set of commands to execute on the local machine for:
# 1. Transfer the .tif images from the local machine to a folder in SVCL server
# 2. Convert the .tif files into jpeg (into the preferred input type of the classifier) using spcconvert
# 3. Deploy the classifier
# 4. Obtain the predictions
# 5. Send the predictions back to SIO server

# Step 1
# We transfer the images on the local machine to the SVCL Server using scp command
# Change the paths accordingly:
# source_path = "/Users/snehakondur/Downloads/spcvisualizer/sampleImgs/sampleImgs"
# dest_path = "/data6/SnehaKondur/"

scp -r /Users/snehakondur/Downloads/spcvisualizer/sampleImgs/sampleImgs /data6/SnehaKondur/



# Step 2
# Using spc convert on the images uploaded to the server
